# Javascript and jQuery!

## First Task
- Forked this directory into your personal account and clone it into your coding_course folder, like you did last week with the bootstrap excercise.
- Added jQuery using a CDN.
- Read through the code in 'background.js' and completed the function which changes the background when the button is clicked

## Extention task
- Changed the text in the span to be the name of an artist when the background changes
